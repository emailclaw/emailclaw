/*
 * Rate limit middleware: forcibly leave a minimum interval between two model calls
 * Implements MiddlewareBase, uses AtomicLong to record the last call timestamp, and uses Mono.delay in onModelCall
 * to delay as needed, ensuring at least the specified duration between two model calls.
 * Injected into ChatService — as a stateful singleton field rateLimitMiddleware (default 500ms interval), initialized in the constructor,
 * and registered to HarnessAgent.Builder via .middleware(rateLimitMiddleware).
 * According to Harness design, user-defined middleware executes before all built-in middleware, so the rate limit logic takes effect at the outermost layer.
